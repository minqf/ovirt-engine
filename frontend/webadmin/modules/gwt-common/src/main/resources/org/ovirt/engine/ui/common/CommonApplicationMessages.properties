lunAlreadyPartOfStorageDomainWarning=LUN is already part of a Storage Domain\: {0}

lunUsedByDiskWarning=LUN is already used by a Disk\: {0}
maxAssignedVmsPerUserHelp=Maximum number of VMs a single user can attach to from this pool. This field must be between 1 and number of VMs in this pool.
megabytes={0} MB
mebibytes={0} MiB
migratingProgress={0}\: {1}
migrationDowntimeInfo=Represents maximum number of milliseconds the VM can be down during live migration. Value of 0 means that VDSM default will be used. (Current engine-wide default is {0}ms)
migrationPolicyInfo=Represents the policy which handles the migration convergence. No migration policy means the hypervisor takes care of convergence.
migrationSelectInfo=When at least one of the VM activated disks use SCSI reservation, migration option is ignored and VM cannot be migrated.\n\nFor Hosted Engine VM, if the mode is set to "manual migration only", the VM can still be automatically migrated by the agent running on the host.
leaseInfoIcon=Using a VM Lease is recommended for Highly Available VMs to prevent a split-brain scenario during VM restart. The selected Storage Domain will be used to synchronize the actual VM state between candidate hosts. Please use a reliable domain (e.g. the one where the VM''s boot disk resides) where the VM will maintain its lease.
resumeBehaviorInfoIcon=A VM behavior when it gets Paused (e.g. due to underlying storage access error). Auto Resume will try to automatically resume the VM once the Storage Domain no longer reports a problem, Leave Paused will leave the VM Paused waiting on user resolution, Kill will make sure that the VM is powered off. It is required for VMs to be powered off before they can be started again on another host. The Kill behavior is the only one allowed for Highly Available VMs with Lease.
hostCpuInfo=Please note that when this field is enabled then Migration mode field default value is changed to ''Allow manual migration only''.
tscFrequencyInfo=When checked, this VM can only be migrated to hosts with matching TSC frequency. This is only valid for High Performance VMs.
nextRunConfigurationCanBeAppliedImmediately=Changes that can be applied immediately\:
nextRunConfigurationCpuValue=CPU
nextRunConfigurationExists=Changes that require Virtual Machine restart\:
nextRunConfigurationMemoryValue=Memory
nextRunConfigurationMinAllocatedMemoryValue=Physical Memory Guaranteed
nextRunConfigurationVmLeaseValue=VM Lease
highPerformanceConfigurationManualChange=The following recommended settings for running the High Performance type with the optimal configuration were not detected. Please consider manually changing of the following before applying\:
